## 3. Entry Points: Where to Start

### A. Main Documentation Portal

Visit [docs.rjvtechnologies.org](https://docs.rjvtechnologies.org) — the central hub for all documentation.

- **Landing Page:**  
  Highlights featured standards, most-accessed guides, and critical updates.
- **Quick Access Links:**  
  Immediate navigation to primary domains: Science, Law, AI, Engineering, Governance, Education, Products, and More.

### B. Universal Search Bar

Located at the top of every documentation page.

- **Search by keyword, phrase, tag, or symbol.**
- Supports boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), wildcards, and phrase search.
- Finds content in page titles, metadata, code samples, and cross-referenced materials.

### C. Sidebar Navigation

- Hierarchically organized by subject, domain, and document type.
- Expandable/collapsible for deep dives into specific standards, protocols, or research areas.
- “Recently Updated” and “Most Popular” sections for quick discovery.

### D. Topical and Semantic Indexes

- **A-Z Index:** Every standard, concept, or model, alphabetically listed and hyperlinked.
- **Field/Discipline Index:** Jump straight to all documents in physics, law, AI, etc.

## 4. Advanced Search Techniques

**To maximize your search efficiency:**

- **Use Quotation Marks:**  
  `"absolute nothingness"` returns only pages with the exact phrase.
- **Use Wildcards:**  
  `grav*` matches gravity, graviton, gravitational, etc.
- **Combine Filters:**  
  `domain:physics author:smith` narrows results to physics docs by Smith.
- **Search Within Code or Equations:**  
  Enter code fragments, variable names, or LaTeX snippets (e.g., `\Phi(a)`).

> **Tip:** The search engine highlights keywords in results, with instant preview snippets.
